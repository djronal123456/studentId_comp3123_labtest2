This is the screenshot of the output on the web. I did not put too much css but I made it at least very user friendly. I also saw that many of the reference images had 5 days extra. As it was not specified in the document I did not add that nor was it provided in the link you gave us. The link that was given only had the current weather which is what I went for which is what you provided.

This is the postman response to calling the api via my APIKey.
